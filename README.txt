To run the tests please download the repository and open it in eclipse. Once in eclipse, make your way to the src/test/java folder and open the package 
concordData. To test Sprint 1 click on the file ConcordDataTests and run the file. To test Sprint 2, click on the JVMServerXMLTest file and run it, then click the JVMServerTest file and run it. You will notice on the left hand side the green bar after each run, this signifies that all tests 
have been completed successfully compared to a red bar which would have meant that a test has failed. 
As of now, I do believe that all of my tests are successful and that I was able to implement and test all of the features in the features document
that we created as a class. 
For Sprint 1, there was one feature that I did not find necessary to implement as there is only one type of role that a user can have which is 
below moderator. This role is Noob and it is automatically assigned to the user when they join the server. It was also unclear what a role below 
moderator is, so I left it to the administrator to specify any role assignments.
For Sprint 2, I believe I have implemented all necessary features based on the google document provided on Moodle.

For Sprint 4B I made a collection of functional tests that are run individually but focus on a specific part of the implementation. First run the 
JVMServerTest.java in src/main/test file, then run viewTests.java, secondViewTest.java, thirdViewTest.java, fourthViewTest.java, and then 
fifthViewTest.java respectively from src/test/java file. I sadly was not able to implement everything as of now, for some reason trying to
 test certain buttons and list views was not possible.
I was unable to implement testing for inviting users to rooms, and profile pictures being loaded in, as well as some functionality of
 DMs although I am not
sure if I would want to be able to delete messages in DMs or reply to them because it seems irrelevant.
