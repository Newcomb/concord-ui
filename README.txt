To run the tests please download the repository and open it in eclipse. Once in eclipse, make your way to the src/test/java folder and open the package 
concordData. To test Sprint 1 click on the file ConcordDataTests and run the file. To test Sprint 2, click on the JVMServerXMLTest file and run it, then click the JVMServerTest file and run it. You will notice on the left hand side the green bar after each run, this signifies that all tests 
have been completed successfully compared to a red bar which would have meant that a test has failed. 
As of now, I do believe that all of my tests are successful and that I was able to implement and test all of the features in the features document
that we created as a class. 
For Sprint 1, there was one feature that I did not find necessary to implement as there is only one type of role that a user can have which is 
below moderator. This role is Noob and it is automatically assigned to the user when they join the server. It was also unclear what a role below 
moderator is, so I left it to the administrator to specify any role assignments.
For Sprint 2, I believe I have implemented all necessary features based on the google document provided on Moodle.

For Sprint 4B I made a single functional test of the application which I believe covers everything that needs to be tested. First run the 
JVMServerTest.java in src/main/test file, then run TestJUnit1.java respectively from src/test/java file.
 
I have implemented the entirety of my sprint, and hopefully tested all necessary features. 
When you run the code on your computer you may notice a java runtime exception error when the tests get to the GameLogs.
I am not sure why this is happening but it does not seem to have any influence on the process of running the application so I stopped trying to fix it. 
I currently have test code at the end of ConcordDataTest.java, around line 470 in JVMServerTest.java (This will take a very long time to run given I did all combinations with 4 players and looks like it is breaking but it is an unkown exception that is not doing anything), 
and around line 930 in TestJUnit1.java. 
These should be run in the order presented above. I have not made any corrections as I do not believe any were necessary, although I did end up leaving out the 
images showing up in the profile but the link is still stored.
