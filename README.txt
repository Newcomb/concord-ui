To run the tests please download the repository and open it in eclipse. Once in eclipse, make your way to the src/test/java folder and open the package 
concordData. To test Sprint 1 click on the file ConcordDataTests and run the file. To test Sprint 2, click on the JVMServerXMLTest file and run it, then click the JVMServerTest file and run it. You will notice on the left hand side the green bar after each run, this signifies that all tests 
have been completed successfully compared to a red bar which would have meant that a test has failed. 
As of now, I do believe that all of my tests are successful and that I was able to implement and test all of the features in the features document
that we created as a class. 
For Sprint 1, there was one feature that I did not find necessary to implement as there is only one type of role that a user can have which is below moderator. This role is Noob and it is automatically assigned to the user when they join the server. It was also unclear what a role below moderator is, so I left it to the administrator to specify any role assignments.
For Sprint 2, I believe I have implemented all necessary features based on the google document provided on Moodle.

For Sprint 4B, first run the JVMServerTest.java in src/main/test, then run viewTests.java from src/test/java. I sadly was not able to implement everything as of now, for some reason trying to test certain buttons and list views was not possible. Im not sure if this had something to do with the Platform.runLater or somehthing else.
I was unable to implement testing for adding and leaving rooms, pinning and unpinning messages, inviting users to rooms, setting role status, kicking users from rooms, setting up DMs, and sending messages in chat. 

I am hoping to come into office hours to clear up some of the issues with testfx I am having, my confusion mainly stems from things seeming to work and then failing what seems like randomly later.
